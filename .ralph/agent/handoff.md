**Original objective:**

```
# Objective
Fix critical training loop bug causing ~100x memory overhead by replacing autoregressive loop with proper parallel Transformer training.

# Context
Current training runs SEQ_LEN forward passes inside a single GradientTape, causing memory to scale as O(SEQ_LEN × model_memory). This is incorrect for Transformers - they should use parallel training with causal masking.

**Current (broken):**
```python
for t in range(1, seq_len):  # 512 iterations!
    pred = self.base_model(ar_input, t...
```
